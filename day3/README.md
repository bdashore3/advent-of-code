# Part 1

- Get the text file and split by newline
- Initialize gamma and epsilon variables
- Run a traditional for loop based on the length of a list element
- Run another foreach loop on the list itself
- Check the char at position i (from the traditional for loop) with a switch and add to the zero/one total
- Compare the zero and one total
- If zeroes are greater than ones, do something and vice versa
- Convert gamma and epsilon strings to integers using parseInt with a radix of 2 (because base 2)
- Multiply the two strings together

# Part 2

- This will take some time to write up and explain. I do not have the time for that at the moment.
